                As a part of the curriculum for the Programming Studio course I
                took in the Fall of 2020, we were required to develop an
                application over a 6-week period that demonstrated a solution to
                a novel problem using several different APIs. My team of 5
                members decided to create an application that, given a phrase in
                the English language, would generate a playlist based on the
                content of that phrase.

                (Pictured above is an example use of Apollo with a test playlist
                name and phrase.)

                To develop Apollo we used
                <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/"
                    >Spotify's Web API</a
                >
                to get songs,
                <a href="https://www.twinword.com/api/sentiment-analysis.php"
                    >Twinword's Sentiment Analysis API</a
                >
                to generate custom playlist images and
                <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech"
                    >Google's Text-to-Speech API</a
                >
                for accessibility. The app itself was built on a Nodejs runtime
                environment.

                How it works is as follows: the user types in a name for their
                playlist and then enters a phrase. Upon hitting the generate
                button, the phrase would be parsed, and each word in the phrase
                would be represented as one song in the playlist. The sentiment
                for the phrase as a whole would determine the image selected for
                the playlist. Whether it is positive, negative, or neutral all
                provides a different image. Once the playlist is generated, a
                user can save the playlist to their Spotify account and play the
                songs within the application. The user also can share the
                playlist via several different options.

                Being on a 5-person team, my contributions were mostly focused
                on sentiment analysis, user actions, and hosting. Analyzing the
                sentiment of the phrase was as simple as passing the phrase to
                Twinword's API which sent back a sentiment score indicating if
                the phrase had a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Upon
                receiving the score, the playlist would be assigned an image
                that attempted to reflect the chosen sentiment. My contributions
                for user actions were focused on developing the process for
                which a user could share their generated playlist within Apollo.
                This was accomplished by generating an Apollo link that would
                fetch the generated playlist from Spotify and display it in
                Apollo. I was finally responsible for getting the application
                hosted, in which I used Heroku to host it for free.

                Most likely the application is not currently live, but if it is
                it can be found
