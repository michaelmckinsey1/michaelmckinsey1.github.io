                As part of my tenure with the Security Operations team at Texas
                A&amp;M, I got the opportunity to revamp an alert that had a
                very solid concept, but happened to be producing a lot of false
                positive events. It was named “Geo-disparate Alert”, and its
                overarching function was to identify if a Texas A&amp;M account
                had logged in from two separate geographical locations, over an
                impossible travel-time period.
            </p>

                For example: if someone logged in to their account in College
                Station, Texas on September 3rd at 12:30pm, and then
                subsequently logged in to the same account in Jammu, India on
                September 3rd at 1:00pm, we would suspect that there must be a
                problem, since even a flight between these two locations would
                take at least 24 hours. Worst case scenario would be that a bad
                actor had access to a Texas A&amp;M account, which is definitely
                unacceptable.

                The alert would provide a list of accounts that had been
                detected logging in from geographically disparate locations over
                the past 24 hours in our ticketing system
                <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/" target="_blank"
                    >ServiceNow</a
                >, which would need to be manually triaged for false positives.
                And there were a lot of false positives. I had found that out of
                the 50-80 accounts that would be reported a day, on average
                70-90% were false positives. This was mainly due to the
                inaccurate distance information that was being reported by
                <a href="https://www.splunk.com/" target="_blank">Splunk</a>,
                our SIEM platform that was being utilized to produce the alert.
                The other big issue was the use of VPN’s, which could appear to
                modify the user’s physical location.

                The resulting python code I developed aimed to solve the two
                above issues. It accomplished this firstly by utilizing
                <a href="https://ipinfo.io/" target="_blank">ipinfo</a>’s IP
                address database instead of Splunk’s, to retrieve more accurate
                location information. Those two locations and their
                corresponding times were then compared against an acceptable
                threshold to see if the login activity was feasible. After this,
                the remaining events were passed on to be checked against a
                manually maintained list of known VPNs, VPSs, and cloud service
                companies. After this point, the remaining events were sent off
                to ServiceNow to be manually triaged.

                During the testing phase of the project, I found that upwards of
                80% of events were now being removed, all of which were
                correctly-identified false positives. This was a great success,
                as the automation of this spared human analysts from wasting a
                lot of time on unnecessary work.
