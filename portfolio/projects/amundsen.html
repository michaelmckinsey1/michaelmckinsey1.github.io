                The primary focus of my 8-week stint with the Data Engineering
                team at RigUp for the summer of 2020 was a data catalog project.
                A data catalog is designed to organize large databases via a
                platform that is more human-friendly and searchable. A couple of
                years ago, the rideshare company Lyft set out to minimize the
                time people spent searching data by creating an open-source data
                cataloguing tool named Amundsen.

                Amundsen’s tag and search bar-based system makes it extremely
                easy to search through various tables in a database.
                Additionally, the large swaths of metadata that is collected by
                Amundsen allows the tool to display very creative information:
                such as showing the most popular tables, usage statistics per
                table, and where a table was sourced or generated from.

                I and another intern, with the support of the Data Engineering
                team, were tasked with implementing a version of Amundsen that
                could be used by RigUp personnel. Personnel which mainly
                consisted of business intelligence analysts, who were the target
                users for the tool. After using
                <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> to
                quickly set up Amundsen’s five microservices on a GCP virtual
                machine, most of the initial work was focused on connecting the
                data pipeline from
                <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/" target="_blank"
                    >Snowflake</a
                >
                to Amundsen’s graph database,
                <a href="https://neo4j.com/" target="_blank">Neo4j</a>. This was
                done <i>almost</i> painlessly using pre-built connectors from
                Amundsen’s data builder library.

                A cool part of the project that I got to handle was generating
                custom usage statistics from user data in Snowflake and
                ingesting those statistics into Amundsen. This was so that we
                could power the "popular table" and "usage data" features that I
                briefly mentioned earlier. The general solution was to take each
                user’s SQL queries and parse them for table names. From which
                the presence of an individual table name was counted as one
                read. Those reads were then aggregated to a dataframe and
                uploaded daily to a table in Snowflake that held all of the
                usage data. That table was then processed and read by Amundsen.

                Also, we got the opportunity to utilize tools like Apache
                Airflow, CircleCI, and GCP to make the development and
                deployment of Amundsen a lot more efficient. By the end of 8
                weeks, RigUp's data catalog was ready to go and accessible
                internally.
