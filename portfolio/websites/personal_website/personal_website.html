                The first version of my personal website was created in late
                2019. Its main purpose was to host the most recent copy of my
                resume. It was all basic html, css, and JavaScript and all the
                assets were my own. The files for that version of the site can
                still be accessed
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/MichaelMcKinsey1/MichaelMcKinsey1.github.io/tree/88afc4ea636bd1e6b89f6c0d0988422dcbf1e6d0"
                    target="_blank"
                    >here</a
                >
                and a toy version of the site itself can be found through this
                <a href="v1/" target="_blank">link</a>. Don't ask me
                why there was a "Home" button.

                The current version of the site is the second iteration. The
                underlying template for this website can be found
                <a

                    >here</a
                >. Development of the current version started in the fall of
                2020.
