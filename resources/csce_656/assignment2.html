                    One theme I noticed is out of my 3 top-level categories
                    (Social Media, Games, and Television) I had at least 2 in
                    common with everyone else.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The depth of everyone's categories was at least 2 and at
                    most 4, with the average being a depth of 3 before a leaf
                    node. For example a top-level category, sub category, and
                    then the specific media (Television -> Sports -> Football).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Everyone had Television in some form. This is arguably the
                    most mainstream and consumed form of media, so it makes
                    sense.

                I could revise my original categorization by going into more
                detail, i.e. categorizing items further and being more specific.
                For example, (Games -> FPS) could become (Games -> PC -> FPS)
                and (Games -> Console -> etc). Something I could also add is
                more leaf nodes, as what is currently listed is only a subset of
                the media I use.
